Project Vision
==============

The Brothers Karamazov YouTube Project explores how classic literature can be transformed into rich multimedia experiences with the help of AI.

Goals
-----
* **Modular design** – each stage of the pipeline is independent and easily replaceable.
* **Extensibility** – both humans and AI agents should be able to iterate on individual components without breaking the whole.
* **Ethical sourcing** – this repository does not distribute copyrighted text. Users provide their own copy of the novel.

Future Directions
-----------------
* Integrate real text-to-speech and image generation models.
* Add timing and alignment information for smoother video assembly.
* Generalize the pipeline to other works of literature.

This structure is intentionally lightweight so that collaborators can expand it in whatever direction they find most interesting.
