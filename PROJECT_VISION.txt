The Brothers Karamazov YouTube Project aims to explore how AI and human collaborators can transform classic literature into multimedia experiences.

Goals:
- Create a modular pipeline where each stage can be improved or swapped out.
- Enable experimentation with text segmentation, dialogue attribution, audio synthesis, and image generation.
- Provide clear artifacts (segments, audio files, image prompts, manifests) that downstream tools can consume.

The structure of this repository is intentionally simple so that future contributors—human or AI—can extend the scripts, replace models, or integrate new technologies.
